# â™ž Knight's Shortest Path Finder

This project implements a solution to find the shortest path for a knight (horse) on an 8x8 chessboard from a given starting position to a target position using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

## ðŸ§  How it works

The knight moves in "L" shapes: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular. This algorithm calculates all legal knight moves from a position and explores the shortest path to reach a target coordinate.

It guarantees the shortest path because BFS visits all positions level by level.
